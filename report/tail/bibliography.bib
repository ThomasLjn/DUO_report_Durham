	abstract = {A barrier to realizing the potential of molecules for quantum information science applications is a lack of high-fidelity, single-molecule imaging techniques. Here, we present and theoretically analyze a general scheme for dispersive imaging of electronic ground-state molecules. Our technique relies on the intrinsic anisotropy of excited molecular rotational states to generate optical birefringence, which can be detected through polarization rotation of an off-resonant probe laser beam. Using 23Na87Rb and 87Rb133Cs as examples, we construct a formalism for choosing the molecular state to be imaged and the excited electronic states involved in off-resonant coupling. Our proposal establishes the relevant parameters for achieving degree-level polarization rotations for bulk molecular gases, thus enabling high-fidelity nondestructive imaging. We additionally outline requirements for the high-fidelity imaging of individually trapped molecules.},

	abstract = {The article presents a study of the strongly spin-orbit coupled singlet A1Σ+ and triplet b3Π states of the RbCs molecule, which provide an efficient optical path to transfer ultracold molecules to their rovibrational ground state. Fourier-transform A1Σ+ − b3Π → X1Σ+ and (4)1Σ+ → A1Σ+ − b3Π laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) spectra were recorded for the natural mixture of the 85Rb133Cs and 87Rb133Cs isotopologues produced in a heat pipe oven. Overall 8730 rovibronic term values of A1Σ+ and b3Π states were determined with an uncertainty of 0.01 cm−1 in the energy range [9012, 14087] cm−1, covering rotational quantum numbers J ∈ [6, 324]. An energy-based deperturbation analysis performed in the framework of the four A1Σ+ − b3ΠΩ = 0, 1, 2 coupled-channels approach reproduces 97\% of the experimental term values of both isotopologues with a standard deviation of 0.0036 cm−1. The reliability of the deperturbed mass-invariant potentials and spin-orbit coupling functions of the interacting A1Σ+ and b3Π states is additionally proved by a good reproduction of the A − b → X and (4)1Σ+ → A − b relative intensity distributions. The achieved accuracy of the A − b complex description allowed us to use the latter to assign the observed (5)1Σ+ → A − b and (3)1Π → A − b transitions. As is demonstrated, LIF to the A − b complex becomes as informative as to the ground X1Σ+ state, which is confirmed by comparing the results of (4)1Σ+ state analysis based on (4)1Σ+ → A − b LIF with the data from V. Zuters et al. [Phys. Rev. A 87, 022504 (2013)] based on (4)1Σ+ → X LIF.},

	abstract = {The current interest in producing ultracold RbCs molecules by optical excitation from weakly bound Feshbach resonances and stimulated decay to the absolute ground state requires detailed analyses of the intermediate excited states. In this study, we present two sets of experimental Fourier-transform spectroscopic data of the 𝐴⁢ 1⁢𝛴+-𝑏⁢ 3⁢𝛱 complex. The 𝐴-𝑏 mixed vibrational levels are the most likely candidates to be intermediates in the molecular formation. The more recent and more accurate data set is from mixed 𝐴-𝑏→𝑋 transitions, while the second is derived in large part from (4)⁢ 1⁢𝛴+→𝐴-𝑏 emission and extends to higher 𝐴-𝑏 energy levels. From a detailed analysis of the spectroscopic data we obtain term values which allow one to construct potentials and spin-orbit functions. Vibrational numbering of the 𝐴 state has been raised by one quantum over a previous report [T. Bergeman et al., Phys. Rev. A 67, 050501 (2003)] while the numbering of the 𝑏 state is established with a considerable degree of certainty with help of data on the 85Rb133Cs and 87Rb133Cs isotopomers. In addition, we have performed calculations of spin-orbit functions by two distinct methods. The fitted spin-orbit coupling matrix element between the two 𝛺𝑝=0+ states, 𝐴⁢ 1⁢𝛴+ and 𝑏⁢ 3⁢𝛱0+, happens to agree rather well with the results from both of these methods, while for the diagonal 𝑏⁢ 3⁢𝛱 state spin-orbit function, the fitted function agrees fairly well with that obtained by the other method.},

Duo solves the Schrödinger equation for the motion of the nuclei not only for the simple case of uncoupled, isolated electronic states (typical for the ground state of closed-shell diatomics) but also for the general case of an arbitrary number and type of couplings between electronic states (typical for open-shell diatomics and excited states). Possible couplings include spin–orbit, angular momenta, spin-rotational and spin–spin. Corrections due to non-adiabatic effects can be accounted for by introducing the relevant couplings using so-called Born–Oppenheimer breakdown curves.},

Absorption measurements are performed using all-sapphire cell filled with a mixture of Rb and Cs. We compare high resolution absorption spectrum of Rb-Cs vapor mixture with pure Rb and Cs vapor spectra from the literature. After detailed analysis, the new satellite bands of RbCs molecule at 418.3 nm, 468.3, and 527.5 nm are identified. The origin of these bands is discussed by direct comparison with difference potentials derived from quantum chemistry calculations of RbCs potential energy curves. These bands originate from the lower Rydberg states of the RbCs molecule. This study thus provides further insight into photoassociation of lower Rydberg molecular states, approximately between Cs(7s) + Rb(5s) and Cs(6s) + Rb(6p) asymptotes, in ultracold gases.},

	abstract = {In this article we address the general approach for calculating dynamical dipole polarizabilities of small quantum systems, based on a sum-over-states formula involving in principle the entire energy spectrum of the system. We complement this method by a few-parameter model involving a limited number of effective transitions, allowing for a compact and accurate representation of both the isotropic and anisotropic components of the polarizability. We apply the method to the series of ten heteronuclear molecules composed of two of (Li,Na,K,Rb,Cs) alkali-metal atoms. We rely on both up-to-date spectroscopically-determined potential energy curves for the lowest electronic states, and on our systematic studies of these systems performed during the last decade for higher excited states and for permanent and transition dipole moments. Such a compilation is timely for the continuously growing researches on ultracold polar molecules. Indeed the knowledge of the dynamic dipole polarizabilities is crucial to model the optical response of molecules when trapped in optical lattices, and to determine optimal lattice frequencies ensuring optimal transfer to the absolute ground state of initially weakly-bound molecules. When they exist, we determine the so-called ‘magic frequencies’ where the ac-Stark shift and thus the viewed trap depth, is the same for both weakly-bound and ground-state molecules.},
