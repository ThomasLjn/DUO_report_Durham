= Potential energy curve and coupling functions

The potential energy curves, the spin-orbit coupling function and the transition dipole moments are all represented in @PEC. The electronic ground state potential energy curve is from ref. @rakic_satellite_2016. The uncoupled excited states potential energy curves and spin-orbit coupling functions are from Ref. @kruzins_extended_2014. The electronic transition dipole moment between the $"X"^1Sigma^+$ and $"A"^1Sigma^+$ electronic states is from Ref. @vexiau_dynamic_2017. The spin-orbit coupling is introduced directly into DUO.
